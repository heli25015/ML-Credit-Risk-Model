# ML-Credit-Risk-Model

This project delivers an AI-powered credit scoring system that predicts loan default probability and assigns real-time credit scores (300–900) with risk categories — Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent.
The solution empowers financial institutions to make data-driven lending decisions and mitigate default risks.
Key Features:

Real-Time Credit Scoring – Instant credit score generation with clear risk classification.

End-to-End ML Pipeline – Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, leakage control, and model validation.

Imbalance Handling – Applied SMOTE-Tomek to address skewed class distributions.

Optimized Performance – Optuna-based hyperparameter tuning achieving AUC: 0.98, Gini: 0.97, and Max KS > 85 in the second decile.

Cloud Deployment – Streamlit-powered intuitive web interface for live predictions.

Technical Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SMOTE-Tomek, Optuna, Streamlit, Matplotlib, Seaborn

This project showcases how machine learning can transform raw applicant data into actionable risk insights, providing a scalable and automated loan assessment solution for the fintech industry.
